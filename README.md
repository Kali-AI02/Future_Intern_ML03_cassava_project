Crop Disease Detection is a web application developed to identify and classify diseases in crop images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application is built with Streamlit and utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model created with TensorFlow and Keras.

#Features Image Upload: Users can upload images of crops to the web application for disease detection. Disease Classification: The application uses a pre-trained CNN model to classify the uploaded image and identify whether the crop is affected by a disease. User-Friendly Interface: The Streamlit interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily interact with the application. Getting Started

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/Kali-AI02/Future_Intern_ML03_cassava_project.git
cd cassava-disease-detection


Open your web browser and navigate to

http://172.31.171.212:8501 

to access the Crop Disease Detection application. Usage Access the application through your web browser. Upload an image of a crop using the provided interface. View the prediction result, indicating whether the crop is affected by a disease. Contributing Contributions to the Crop Disease Detection project are welcome. If you find a bug or have an enhancement in mind, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle. It consists of images of cassava leaves labeled into different disease categories, such as:

Healthy
Cassava Mosaic Disease
Cassava Brown Streak Disease
The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
